# Ruby on Rails unobtrusive scripting adapter

rails-ujs was [moved into Rails itself](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/ad3a47759e67a411f3534309cdd704f12f6930a7) in Rails 5.1.0.

Future development now [lives in Action View](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/actionview/app/assets/javascripts).

For older Rails apps, see the [rails-ujs master branch here](https://github.com/rails/rails-ujs/tree/master).

(Right now you're looking at an empty branch that's only here to alert you to the move into Rails.)
